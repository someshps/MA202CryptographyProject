# MA202CryptographyProject
This repository contains our work done for the course project as a part of MA202 at IIT Gandhinagar. 

Our project aims to implement a symmetric encryption-decryption algorithm which is developed using steganography and the encryption and decryption is done using three different numerical methods. The encryption is done using the concept of one-way function and then finally steganography is used to encrypt it.

The project was a collaborative work by 5 students at IIT Gandhinagar:
1. Ayush Anand, Discipline of Computer Science and Engineering
2. Shreyshi Singh, Discipline of Computer Science and Engineering
3. Siddhi Surawar, Discipline of Material Science and Engineering
4. Somesh Pratap Singh, Discipline of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering
5. Xhitij Choudhary, Discipline of Chemical Engineering
