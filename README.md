# MA202CryptographyProject
This repository contains our work done for the course project as a part of MA202 at IIT Gandhinagar. 

Our project aims to implement a symmetric encryption-decryption algorithm which is developed using steganography and the encryption and decryption is done using three different numerical methods. The encryption is done using the concept of one-way function and then finally steganography is used to encrypt it.
